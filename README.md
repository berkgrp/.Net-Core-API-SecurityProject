# .Net Core-API-SecurityProject
It's a project for my Web Application Security lesson.
In that project, i'm trying to apply some applications about security on .Net Core 5.0 API.
There will be Bearer Authentication, N-Tier Architecture, UnitOfWork and Generic Repository Pattern,
Database by Code-First approach with Fluent Api, Performance Optimised Linq and one example web project which consumes API.
